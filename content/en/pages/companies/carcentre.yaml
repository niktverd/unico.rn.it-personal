        **December 2019 - January 2020: Lean Startup Approach**

        We launched with a simple landing page to test market demand, invested just $5 in advertising, and recorded our first sale on day one - suspension bushings for a Mitsubishi ASX.

        **February 2020: Early Growth**

        We developed a basic application with a form interface, hired sales representatives, and began directing traffic to our platform.

        **March - April 2020: Pandemic Challenges**

        Despite the global lockdown, we continued operations until our team contracted COVID-19, resulting in a month of downtime.

        **June 2020: Scaling Attempt**

        We attempted to scale operations tenfold but faced significant challenges that revealed fundamental issues with our business model.

        **July 2020: Critical Analysis**

        We conducted a thorough analysis of our operations and reached crucial insights about the auto parts market.

      **The Auto Parts Challenge**

      Unlike consumer products such as smartphones or cosmetics, auto parts require specialized expertise:

      - Deep understanding of vehicle structure and mechanics
      - Ability to interpret technical diagrams and schematics
      - Critical thinking skills to ensure proper component selection

      Our key discovery: selling auto parts online while assuming the costs of part selection expertise makes the business model fundamentally uncompetitive.

        To overcome the fundamental challenge in auto parts sales, we must either:

        - Fully automate the parts selection process, or
        - Develop copilot technology that dramatically increases human expert efficiency

        Both approaches aim to drastically reduce the cost of parts selection while maintaining or improving accuracy.

        - Deployed data parsers with 1,000 virtual machines per vehicle added to the service
        - Developed sophisticated search algorithms using vectorization, bi-encoders, and cross-encoders
        - Conducted user testing with our prototypes
        - Continued development on AI-powered copilot technology to assist parts specialists
